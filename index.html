		<h2>fashion 💃 </h2>

		<p>
		 Since childhood, I have always been deeply interested in the Fashion universe and art, like going to an art exhibition, drawing, sewing… 🌻
		 I did an Stylist internship at LISAA (Higher Institute of Applied Arts) & I did two internships in fashion one at Chanel & the second at Philippine Jansens (a custom pants creation company. 
		 I like going to an exhibition of fashion as i went to the Yves St Laurent museum at Marrakesh.

			   I did road trip which incredible, one in Islande (i did boat in the middle of icebergs ❄️), one in America to San Francisco from Los Angeles 🇺🇸 & one in Cambodia, Vietnam & Taiwan 🌄 which was I think my best trip I ever did.
